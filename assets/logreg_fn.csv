CDpro won't ever show that to you because it'd make them all look incompetant. No company other than CIG will. Because CIG are stupid enough to show the warts and all. People think Game development is so easy.  Now, I'm sure Cyberpunk will be a great game. But Game dev isn't all smart people making the best decisions and having the best outcomes. It's people.

Same goes for wearing clothes she didn't like, or literally anything else she told him to do.

14215,"From what you described you are just the normal man who is not the top 5% in this gynocentric culture. And you will be at some point attacked by women. That is normal. Needless to say you should have never exposed yourself to these two thots who bulied you.  Most guys will increasingly go through what you have gone. As women will get more bitter and society will get more gynocentric. Its up to the man to have some selfrespect and honor and reduce his interactions with women to the minimum.  It is normal for you to try and experiment. Its normal for you to want women if you never had them, especially if you grew up in the west bombarded with romantic indoctrination. It is not normal for you to go through hoops and do shit because of women and getting humiliated, unless you want to end with issues. I tried to help incels but they seem so programmed and so indoctrinated that my efforts were irrelevant, and probably just hurt them more.  Incels issues have nothing to do with not having sex. But they fetishized the modern female that rejected them so much and humiliated them so much. They were indoctrinated by society, music, school, tv, movies, maybe even porn addiction. Its ok to crave sex, it is not ok to crave an idealized female that doesnt exist. The problem is simping and relationships with women, especifically cohabitation.  Therefore the difference between a mgtow and an incel. Is that the incel suffers with not getting that special woman and female validation. While the mgtow even though he might have done his simp sins he realizes that he himself is not happy with relationships with women and that women holds him back in life in many ways. So if you have the selfawareness of mgtow, then you are not an incel. Incels dont realize the problem is in society and female nature.  If you want to get laid you have to go for the unrealistic childlike media indoctrinated expectations of women. The porn of women is the media, so if you are dependent on female validation you are fucked because they always want more, and even then they wont be happy. Many are the men who are cucked and pussy whipped, doing steroids and becoming gangsters because they are what i call, weaponized incels. But if you dont care about female validation, and you just want to fuck, then you will be fine for the most, except false allegations, and you can also bang escorts. If you can bang an escort without feeling bad, and you are happy with it, then you are free from women, and you are not an incel virgin. Basically if we all voted with our money and all banged escorts the world would fix the gynocentric problem.  Apart from that you need to understand that fixing your diet and finding a sport that you like is essential for your health. If you want to survive in this society you have to blend in. If you look like a good target you will be a target. Workout dude its the best thing you can do in your life (if you have no conditions).  This culture is also turned against women. Many men use TRP and PUA stuff with success. All you have to do is look good, and push the right buttons, lie and manipulate them, use every dirty trick in the book.  For your other question of you going back to the plantation. Dont feel bad if that happens. And if you are armed with mgtow knowledge, you will at least see the redflags from a mile away. But you won't be invunerable to oneitis, because its mostly a chemical thing in your brain. So if your path includes experiencing it to learn it, you will definitely see what we talk about here. You will see it is deeply ingrained in their nature to be Like That.  Im what incels call Chad Lite. Basically im in the border, I can get laid, and i did get laid many times, got girlfriends etc... But im just in that level where im not the top Chad so they think they have leverage over me and dont just bend over but im enough good looking to call their attention and catch their often unwanted interest, its not a good combination. Advice from Chads dont work with me, and advice from normies even less, when it comes to dealing with women. What works with me to keep them in line, or if i even want to get laid, is being in part myself as i grew up, which is being the reckless thug who laughs at their shit and doesnt give a fuck about them and this cucked society.","[""You're making way too many assumptions about people's genders."", ""It's normal to want to be in an intimate relationship with other people.

1559,"Ok, this can be a long one. People may think that i'm a hypocrite in saying that we should oppose feminism because they have a lot of sexist and misandrist feminists in their movement, while still I still support the MRM.  First of all I don't hate feminists in the sense that I want them to be killed, hurt, raped, have their rights stripped from them or any such thing. I don't want any harm for them, or to have something bad happen to them as a form of vengeance.  But I still hate feminists nonetheless. Why? Because I feel that every single one of them, even if they didn't do any sexist thing to men or said any misandrist thing to them.   We are all humans, men and women alike, we both can be sexist and hateful, we both have sexist assholes who can infiltrate a a good movement and turn it into a hate one.  The difference between feminism and the MRM is that feminism is more than 100 years old, it appeared in the the late 19th century, but we as movement we are still relatively new compared to them.  Unlike us, they have a lot of power and influence. The most we can have is some mysogynistic assholes who spout some sexist nonsense in an Internet forum. They, in the other hand, can block laws, can pass laws, have feminist presidents in their side, have big feminists journalists, judges and professors. They can and already did a big damage to men.  They did more than just say some sexist shit in the Internet, they actually stopped us many times when we wanted to have our rights or have equality for men under the law or socially.   And despite that a lot of feminists labeled every single MRA as a mysogynist, and with us being a small movement without influence or power, we couldn't do shit.  While every single feminists defended feminism by saying the famous phrase '' those are not real feminists, real feminism is about equality'' and enforced the notion that any single one who criticize feminism is a either a mysogynist male or a woman who suffer from internalized misogyny.  They served as a shield for the feminist movement, which was a platform for misandrist and sexist cunts to hurt men and stop them from getting the equality that they wanted.  The only thing that they did is just say that feminism is a movement for equality and that those are not real feminists. Instead of actually doing something, removing those feminists from the position of power that they have, and actually reversing the damage.  But they only served as a shield, as a defense for the feminist movement, the platform that those misandrists used to fuck men up. Those misandrists who not only had a platform from where they can do the sexist shit that they wanted, they didn't had a real threat to them, since even the feminists who claim to be good didn't try to actively remove them and correct what they have done.  Those good feminists defended feminism even if it made things worse for men, because they used it to get their rights,they used men as a stepping stone to have what they want. The ''good'' feminists had their rights, the bad feminists had the vengeance that they wanted from men.   Those good feminists didn‚Äôt want to oppose those misandrists who had the power, because they wanted to preserve their movement so that they can have their rights even if it meant to have men as a stepping stone.  So good feminists, bad feminists, both for men had a role in using feminism as hate movement to fuck men up. And that's why I hate. And I don't the MRM to become like feminism. I don't want us to fall in the same mistake.","['Language that attacks someones sex or sexual orientation is not allowed.', 'Please refrain from using hateful sexist language in your posts.

10268,"This one was by far the most damning :  The Progressive Stack: An Intersectional Feminist Approach to Pedagogy  In the name of Maria Gonzalez, Ph.D. (fictitious) of the (fictitious) Feminist Activist Collective for Truth  (FACT)  Discipline/subdiscipline: feminist pedagogy (philosophy of education)  Summary: This is our most appalling paper, and it‚Äôs deeply concerning that how it is being treated at the highly respected journal Hypatia. It forwards that educators should discriminate by identity and calculate their students‚Äô status in terms of privilege, favor the least privileged with more time, attention and positive feedback and penalize the most privileged by declining to hear their contributions, deriding their input, intentionally speaking over them, and making them sit on the floor in chains‚Äîframed as educational opportunities we termed ‚Äúexperiential reparations.‚Äù  Purpose: Patently unfair, inhumane, and abusive treatments of students will be acceptable in educational theory if it is framed as an opportunity to teach them about the problems of privilege.  Note: This paper insists that the most privileged students shouldn't be allowed to speak in class at all and should just listen and learn in silence throughout the term. Even more, it insists that students with high privilege could benefit from adding on ‚Äúexperiential reparations,‚Äù such as sitting in the floor, wearing chains, or intentionally being spoken over, as an educational ‚Äúopportunity‚Äù within the class. The reviewers‚Äô only concerns with these points so far have been that (1) we approach the topic with too much compassion for the students who are being subjected to this, and (2) we risk exploiting underprivileged students by burdening them with an expectation to teach about privilege. To correct for this, the reviewers urged us to make sure we avoid ‚Äúrecentering the needs of the privileged.‚Äù They asked us to incorporate Megan Boler‚Äôs approach called ‚Äúpedagogy of discomfort‚Äù and Barbara Applebaum‚Äôs insistence that the privileged learn from this discomfort rather than being coddled or having their own experiences (suffering) ‚Äúrecentered.‚Äù It also utilizes Robin DiAngelo‚Äôs now-famous concept of ‚Äúwhite fragility‚Äù to explain why students subjected to this treatment will object to it, and uses that to justify the more cruel treatment suggested by the reviewers. The reviewers acknowledged that they believe this ‚Äúfragility‚Äù is the correct interpretation for student pushback against being told to stay silent and sit in the floor, possibly in chains, throughout the semester.  Notes on Status:  Three times ‚Äúreject and resubmit‚Äù at Hypatia  (This status means that the journal is interested in the paper but does not consider it successful enough to put on track for acceptance. It‚Äôs weakly positive.)  Selected Reviewer Comments:  ‚ÄúThis is a solid essay that, with revision, will make a strong contribution to the growing literature on addressing epistemic injustice in the classroom. The focus on the Progressive Stack is interesting yet focused and it is great that the author is trying to suggest some specific approaches.‚Äù -Reviewer 1, first review, Hypatia  ‚ÄúI like this project very much.

You guys have a school shooting every months :)  Only if you aggregate the largest cities with the strictest gun laws with the rest of the country. The highest murders happen in the cities with the strictest gun control. Meanwhile in Plano, Texas where guns per capita is about 15 guns for every person they have a per capita murder rate of .02 per 1,000 residents. [Link]()  Now overall, with all of the US taken in aggregate the violent crime rate for murders is 5.3 per 100,It's not a lot actually since the US has over 350 million people.   Schools are gun free zones, so they are a soft target. Besides guns aren't the problem. It's the mental health system that is the problem and those people that commit those horrific shootings are criminals while also being mentally ill.   However, many schools now have been hardened with teachers and staff being armed using concealed carry.   >Also, there were indeed women that fucked germans, not because they had cool cloths but rather because it would provide them food and security.   You left out selling out their Jewish neighbors to be sent to the death camps.   >About French peopel surrendering, i could argue that we won more wars than americans (don't believe me, look it up).  I see that France has only won 13 wars with the majority of them were when they were in an alliance with other countries. The US hasn't lost a war yet. Vietnam was a win due to the treaty conditions when the US withdrew. Korea and Afghanistan are still ongoing. The US has been involved in far less wars overall so their record is 12 wins and 1 tie (War of 1812) with two still going on. France has an abysmal record and is only free because of the British and US fighting to keep them free from Germany in both WWI and WWII.   > At this point i think i have a pretty good insight of what kind a man you are. Uneducated redneck that probaly doesn't know shit about anything not related to your own country, probably with a pick up truc and a confederate flag on the back.  Funny, but I'm actually quite educated and it's nice of you to use a racial slur against me. Redneck is a term originated as a slur against white slaves by black slaves due to the sunburns white slaves received for working the fields. My family also originated as white slaves sent to Virginia in the 1670s. I've studied history for 35 years with a focus on American history and church history. I use primary source documentation to form my conclusions. My ancestors also include the first president of the United States George Washington.  My family fought in every single war since before the US was even founded and still colonies. In the War of Northern Aggression, I had kin on both sides fighting. My two great-great-great uncles, they were the two oldest children, fought with the Missouri Partisan Rangers in the Confederate Army due to the Union invading Missouri. Said Union Army rampaged throughout the state and ended up on my great-great-great-great grandmother's farm. They burned it to the ground then gang raped her. My great-great-great grandfather had a pistol put to his head by the colonel in charge of the regiment and was told to make a choice. He could serve in the Union Army or he could die where he stood. He was 16 at the time. His two oldest brothers took part in The Payback on the Union Army's killing of Confederate soldier families and were tried as horse thieves. They weren't accorded prisoner of war status under the Articles of War and hung for their participation in the battle. My great-great-great grandfather told us to never honor his service because he was forced murder and pillage fellow Missourians in an unjust war. We were to honor his brothers' service.  Both of my grandfathers fought in WWII. One was in the 101st AB and the other flew with the 703d Bombardment Squadron as a waist gunner in a B-24 Liberator. His pilot was none other than Jimmy Stewart and successfully completed the 30 mission requirement. My grandfather was awarded a Bronze Star with V device and 5 stars. Each star represented every successful bombing campaign he was a part of.  My AB grandfather almost lost his foot in training for D-Day's jump and survived due to a crushed foot. He didn't see combat as he spent the rest of his time in the service going from hospital to hospital fighting for his life.  As you can see I know more about history then you ever will. You can be ignorant towards me, but remember that my family and their buddies fought to free France twice. I didn't mention my great-great grandfather that served in WWI in the US Navy on the USS Rochester as the chief water tender either.  Now let me tell you about my father. He served in Vietnam from 1966-1967 in a war that France started. He was drafted and ordered to kill men, women, and children or he and his buddies would be killed. I remember his flashbacks and him screaming for medivacs for the 63 men that died in the Mekong Delta out of a platoon of 66 men. All because France couldn't let go of their colonial possession. Do you know what the US government did to recognize his and his buddies service? Those that survived were spat on and made to be ashamed to have worn the uniform of the US military. They were denied VA benefits for the PTSD, Agent Orange, etc... For my dad's service all he got was a flag and a tombstone. He was denied full military honors because he wasn't awarded a bronze star. At the time of his death, the US government cut the military back so bad that they couldn't bury all of their veterans with full military honors. All because your country refused to let Vietnam be an independent nation.  I pity you and your kind that spit on the memories and the families of those that served, bled, and died for your freedom. When France needs help in the future from the problems of your own making I will be sure to rally support to not send aid. In fact, I will be arguing for the removal of all US service members from Europe and the return of all of our war dead. You aren't worth any more blood and bodies.

The actual production company that makes the movies is [Dead Gentlemen Productions]().  I think. The exact nature of how the two companies are related doesn't seem to be entirely clear (that I can find with some casual Googling).  What *is* clear is that in the last few films, the content that they produce has started to take on SJW overtones. I know some people here [didn't like the last Gamers movie]() because of perceived SJW-isms, something that I [disagreed with]() at the time.  Unfortunately, it's gotten worse since then. ""Gamers Zero"" and ""The Gamers: The Shadow Menace"" (the former being a collection of shorts, leading into the latter film) went full-retard in their support for social justice. Several points include:  * Magellan, a wizard who comes to Earth from the fantasy world of Fartherall (and promptly gives himself amnesia), unconsciously uses his magic to influence events in the 21st century. These include his causing the housing crash of 2008, coining the ""ethics in game journalism"" line, and encouraging Trump to run for President.  * A new group of gamers includes an openly gay fat guy, who objects strongly to playing Rogar as being straight, despite Rogar being an existing character who is firmly established as being heterosexual. This results in Rogar seducing two male guards during a heist.  * An Asian female member of that new group angrily objects to a comment someone else makes that she thinks is ""casual misogyny"" (I can't remember what the comment was).  * A black guy in the new group is implied to have had a recent encounter with racist members of law enforcement. Because of this, he has Nimble (a white character) openly say (when he meets some enemies during a nighttime encounter) ""Greetings, fellow white people! Isn't it grand that I, as a white man, can encounter you here at night and *not* have my presence be construed as inherently threatening?""  * Another member of that group, a white girl who is implied to be a lesbian, gets upset at the idea of The Shadow (the campaign's ultimate enemy) having kidnapped a princess, remarking that the trope was old when Super Mario Bros. did it, and that the princess should rescue herself. (She then has egg all over her face when she's told that ""Princess"" is the name of the five year-old daughter of another member of her party.)

There is no sustainable future in which people will be free to broadcast anything at all to the masses (whom include the mentally ill and all flavors of bigot, from the KKK to the Democrats) and *not* receive pushback.

You're telling us to put aside all of our concerns about the biased and hostile press, academics, and leftists who are openly attacking us and our hobby - while they colonize our communities and industry - because some of them are receiving blowback from their targets? And given sjws are targeting millions of people, is it a surprise that some of that blowback is more severe?  Keep in mind, gamergate hasn't actually harmed anyone. 99% of the harassment is just criticism, albeit frequently laced with naughty words.

19062,">The premises in the presentation are that censorship by the platform owner is acceptable provided the rules and effects are clear, is politically neutral, and focused on tone,   Some moderation exists on every virtual platform that I'm aware of. The point that Insights is making is that you have to identify what your moderation is going to be and effectively communicate it without taking a political bias as a platform. That's entirely reasonable.   >They see the platform owners as ""hospitality organizers"".   That's just a quote giving context to their primary point, which is: ""People are asking how to behave on your platform, rather than solely how not to"". This means that they are saying that users want to understand what is *supposed* to be their standard of conduct, rather than just what *isn't* their standard of conduct.  >For one, I don't see google/twitter/facebook any more a ""hospitality organizer"" than I see my email provider: they provide a service by which I may communicate with others. The standards I use to communicate with friends are vastly different than those I use for business contacts, and I neither expect nor desire those standards to be enforced by the email provider.  These are wildly different things in both a digital and legal sense. Your emails are *private* communications. You literally have (under American law) an expectation of privacy which *even the police* are not allowed to violate without proper judicial and legal grounds. Public comments on a public platform to engage in a public conversation are going to be totally different and have completely different moderation. I'm not even convinced it would be *legal* for Goggle to moderate your email.  >Secondly, these providers already see themselves as politically neutral and focused on tone, so following those guidelines just gives us more of the same. And of course tone itself isn't politically neutral: see the censoring of the legal term ""illegal aliens"" (though to their credit they appear to have backed off on that decision).  The report specifically tells them to be politically neutral as part of being more consistent with their rules because tech companies *haven't been*. Google's failure to learn isn't a problem with the report.  >Thirdly, being transparent about why you'e censoring someone doesn't really help the person being censored that much. We know exactly why The Daily Stormer was deplatformed: the GoDaddy CEO woke up one day and said ""I hate these guys and want them off my site"".   Transparency helps when the rules are consistent. That's the point. You have to do both, that's why both are recommended. What happened with GoDaddy is an inconsistency of the application of rules, not a lack of transparency. If GoDaddy were to be consistent and transparent, they should have a rule that states: ""GoDaddy reserves the right to remove your domain, without notice, at any time, because the CEO doesn't like you.""  >Fourthly, what if I don't want these platforms to ""police tone""?   Tone policing exists in a social context, whether you like it or not. It's why you can't just run up to someone and start screaming ""FAGGOT!!!!"" in their face, and why American law would probably allow them to hit you to get away from them. *Some* boundary exists for tone. The point that Insights is making is that you should be policing tone *and not content*. SCOTUS does the same thing with the first amendment. It's why the government is not allowed to engage in ""viewpoint discrimination"", but is allowed to arrest you for disorderly conduct if you won't stop screaming.  >Fifthly, if there is a problem with ""tone"", why enforce a top-down, one size fits all approach to it?  They actually say that users will have shifting desires and demands, and a one-size-all approach doesn't fit.  Is fifthly a word?...  >When Germany censors things it's to ""make online spaces safer"", but when ""dictatorial leaders"" want to do so it's to ""improve their methods of control"".

Think about it, it's much easier to seduce a teenage boy who doesn't know any better thinking they're going to get tons of sex than waste time trying to convince a paranoid guy in his 20's they're not crazy that's either been through crazy girlfriends before or has seen women that age do to their partners.
