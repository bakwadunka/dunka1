I can’t stand being hit by anyone, especially if they’re smaller than me and doing it because I won’t do anything back.   With that being said, I’d like a statistic on harm done. I’ve had multiple women hit me over the years and no one has come close to hurting me a little. 1 punch from me and it would’ve been hospital for them.   I’m all about equality and think anyone trying to physically harm you should be put in their place, but that statistic makes it sound like men a physically abused, but let’s be real, it’s rare a woman can actually hurt us physically.   I just think punishments for men hitting a woman back should be non existent. Regardless of damage. Someone tries to hurt you, you defend yourself. ', ""4. \tDouble standards are a piss-take, but if you abolish punishments for retaliation then if someone was to seriously injure someone or do something completely uncalled for they won't get in trouble"", '5. \tI should’ve specified that I meant within the confines of the law. Specifically self defense.   If a girl or guy comes up to me and slaps me hard just once, and doesn’t engage further, it would not be self defense for me to strike them back (at least where I live).  There were a couple of times where one of my girlfriends got really angry at me and started punching me as hard as she could, repeatedly. One time was while I was driving and she was hitting my arms and body. I was allowing it because it really didn’t hurt, and after a few seconds she kept escalating and scratched me. At that point I could’ve smacked her asleep, but I pushed her back with my arm and got loud. Then I said “I’m gonna fucking hurt us both, watch this” and started speeding towards a light pole. Scared her shitless. If she hadn’t stopped when I pushed her back and raised my voice, I would’ve hit her to make her stop.   The other time she got on top of me while I was in bed fresh out of the hospital with a sprained foot, and she got on top of me and started gorilla smashing my chest and arms. Didn’t hurt at all, but she had every intention of hurting me, and kept going until I stopped it with my voice.  If she wasn’t my girlfriend though and did the same thing in both situations, she would’ve been smacked hard once, and punched hard after if she continued. If she got punched and happened to end up in a hospital, there should be 0 punishment.  ', ""6. \tJesus, I rlly don't mean to offend but that some gfs you've had.  I see what you mean about gender equality, for example if a man was to be caught cheating everyone would be fine with his gf to slap him (I've even seen this happen in front of police) but vice versa and someone would probably end up in jail"", '7. \tNone taken.   I wasn’t even in the real of having cheated, btw.   I just make it very clear from the gate what my stance is on men hitting women, and I guess mistakenly made it clear that they can’t hurt me if they tried, and I wouldn’t care unless they hit my face.   Either way. Most of my close friends, if not all, have been hit by at least 1 girlfriend. That’s why there’s a statistic supporting that there’s more physical abuse towards men than women in relationships. I just don’t compare the two because I doubt many women could hurt a man unless you decide to allow it. Still should be punished equally, though.
